            <p>
              Piano enthusiast, football player, and an avid Pok√©mon fan (Gen 4 and below). I love finding
              balance between technical precision and creative expression.
            </p>

            <h3>üéÆ Tech Exploration</h3>
            <p>
              Currently diving into Three.js, creating immersive 3D web experiences that push the boundaries of
              modern web development. I&apos;ve done backend development in the past and I&apos;m actively expanding my
              skills and knowledge across the stack.
            </p>

            <h3>üåç Global Perspective</h3>
            <p>
              Proficient in German and learning French (A1 on Duolingo‚Äîthough I speak it a bit better in my opinion).
              Growing up abroad shaped my ability to connect with and adapt to different cultures and environments.
            </p>

            <h3>ü§ù Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
              My diverse background makes me culturally aware and open to new ideas, which helps me be a strong
              team player who values clarity, listening, and momentum.
            </p>

            <p>
              I&apos;ve traveled around 25 countries, learning different perspectives and cultures. Branching out into
              different fields and areas of expertise has made me very open to trying new things.
